# Code Review - DietiEstates

This document provides a code review for the specified directories and files within the DietiEstates project.

## `FrontEndTS/DietiEstates/app/(protected)/(buyer)`

### `_layout.tsx`

-   **Overall:** The layout component is simple and clean, using `expo-router`'s `Stack` component effectively.
-   **Suggestions:**
    -   Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the `Stack` and its screen options, especially if custom options are used. This will improve maintainability and understanding for future developers.
    -   If specific animation or header configurations are planned, add TODO comments as reminders for future implementation.

### `search.tsx`

-   **Overall:** The component fetches and displays property data based on search parameters. The use of `useState` and `useEffect` is appropriate for managing loading state and fetching data.
-   **Suggestions:**
    -   **Type Safety:** The `fetchProperties` function could benefit from more specific typing. Define an interface or type for the API response to improve type safety and avoid potential runtime errors.
    -   **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling to provide user-friendly feedback. Currently, errors are logged to the console, but the user interface doesn't reflect any error state. Consider adding a state variable to track errors and display an appropriate message to the user.
    -   **Component Structure:** Improve the component's structure for better readability and maintainability. Separate the rendering of the `ActivityIndicator` and `FlatList` into dedicated sub-components or functions. This will make the main render function cleaner and easier to understand.
    -   **Mock Data:** The mock data is clearly marked with a TODO, which is good practice.
    -   **Navigation:** The `handlePropertyPress` function currently only logs to the console. Add a TODO comment to remind to implement navigation to the property details screen.

## `FrontEndTS/DietiEstates/components/Buyer`

### `BuyerPropertyCard.tsx`

-   **Overall:** This component correctly composes the `PropertyCard` and adds favorite functionality.
-   **Suggestions:**
    -   **Memoization:** Consider using `React.memo` to optimize rendering if this component is frequently re-rendered without changes in props. This can improve performance, especially in large lists.
    -   **Favorite Logic:** Ensure the `onToggleFavorite` logic and visual feedback are consistent. The accessibility label is correctly implemented, which is good for accessibility.

### `CategoryButton.tsx`

- **Overall**: The component is well-structured and uses themed components correctly.
- **Suggestions**:
    - **Props Discrepancy**: There's a discrepancy between the props expected by `CategoryButton` (`icon`, `label`) and how it's used in `Home.tsx` (where `title` and `count` are passed). **This needs to be fixed for consistency.** Either update `CategoryButton` to accept `title` and `count` or change the usage in `Home.tsx` to pass `icon` and `label`.
    - **Accessibility**: The `accessibilityRole="button"` is correctly used.

### `Home.tsx`

-   **Overall:** The component displays a search header, category buttons, and location cards.
-   **Suggestions:**
    -   **Props Consistency:** Ensure the props passed to `CategoryButton` match the expected props (as mentioned above).
    -   **Scalability:** The component structure is currently manageable. However, as more features are added, consider breaking down the component into smaller, more manageable sub-components to prevent it from becoming too large and complex.
    -   **Search Functionality:** The `handleSearch` function is a placeholder. Add a TODO comment to implement the actual search functionality.

### `LocationCard.tsx`, `SearchHeader.tsx`, and `TabBar.tsx`

-   **Overall:** These components are generally well-organized and use themed components appropriately.
-   **Suggestions:**
    -   **Accessibility:** Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate accessibility labels and roles. `accessibilityLabel` is used in several places, which is good. Check for `accessibilityState` where applicable (e.g., in `TabBar.tsx`).
    -   **Comments:** Add comments to explain any non-obvious logic or design choices. This will improve the maintainability of the code.

## `FrontEndTS/DietiEstates/hooks/useFavorites.ts`

-   **Overall:** The hook correctly uses `AsyncStorage` to manage favorite properties.
-   **Suggestions:**
    -   **Error Handling:** Improve error handling to provide user feedback. Currently, errors are only logged to the console. Consider adding a way to notify the user of any issues with saving or loading favorites, perhaps through a toast message or a state variable that can be used to display an error message.
    -   **Type Checking:** Add more robust type checking to handle cases where data retrieved from `AsyncStorage` might be missing or in an unexpected format.
    -   **Optimization:** The use of `useCallback` is appropriate for optimizing performance and preventing unnecessary re-renders.
