Before processing any request for the TypeScript/React Native client:

1.  Review `context copy.md` for general context and guidelines.
2.  Analyze `UseCaseDiagram-2.drawio.html` for relevant use cases.
3.  Examine `ClassDiagram-(UMLDiagram).drawio.html` for class structure and relationships.
4.  Check `CodeReview_Report_20250428.md` for relevant issues.
5.  Review `Improvement_Plan.md` for planned improvements impacting the client.

Proceed only after analyzing the required documents (`context.md`, `UseCaseDiagram-2.drawio.html`, `ClassDiagram-(UMLDiagram).drawio.html`). Base your response on the information provided within them.

A task for the TypeScript/React Native client is considered complete only when:

1.  The TypeScript/React Native code executes without errors.
2.  Unit tests (e.g., using Jest) are written for the implemented logic.
3.  All written tests pass successfully.
